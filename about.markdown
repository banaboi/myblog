Hey there! I'm Luke, a software engineer living in Australia, and this is my little corner of the internet.

Pixel Lifting Luke is a place where I share my experiences, insights, and the things that keep me busy when I'm not in front of a computer screen. From coding and gaming to running, lifting, and watching movies, it's a mix of everything that makes up my daily life.

# Why Pixel Lifting Luke?

I chose Pixel Lifting Luke because it's a reflection of who I am – just a regular person with a love for technology, games, fitness, and a good movie. No frills, just a space to share what I'm learning and doing.

# What to Expect?

Expect a bit of everything – tech talk, gaming stories, fitness tips, and maybe a movie or two. I'm no expert, just someone navigating through the challenges of a software career while enjoying some hobbies along the way.

# Join Me

If you're into coding, gaming, fitness, or just looking for a casual read, you're in the right place. Feel free to comment, share your thoughts, or drop me a message. Let's make this space a chill and welcoming corner of the internet.

Thanks for stopping by, and welcome to Pixel Lifting Luke!
